1. This repository contains the epxerimental flow cytometer data and simulation data for the article.
2. The simulation data is in the directory simulation_data.
3. Experimental flow cytometer data are included in directories EvolvR (for Fig2), IFFL_gain (for Fig3), IFFL_loss (for Fig 4), regulator_lacI and regulator_lacO (for Fig 5), feedback_lacI and feedback_lacO (for Fig 6).
4. The Stochastic_simulation.ipynb includes code to run and analyze simulation. The facs_data.ipynb includes code to run and analyze flow cytometer data.
